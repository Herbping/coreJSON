# Substitution command to pass to sed for patching core_json.c. The
# characters " and # must be escaped with backslash.

# The following line was the original version. However, for the unbounded and termination
# proofs of skipString, we must NOT replace any auxiliary functions with stubs. 
# If we used stubs (instead of the genuine code), the unbounded and termination proofs will
# not work. So we remove the underscore (i.e. the second-to-last character) in the following line. 
#CORE_JSON_SED_EXPR = 1s/^/\#include \"core_json_annex.h\" /; s/^static //; s/bool skip(Escape|UTF8)\b/&_/

# This is the line we need for the unbounded and termination proof of skipString.
